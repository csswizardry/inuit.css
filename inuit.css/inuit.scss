/**
 * inuit.css acts as a base stylesheet which you should extend with your own
 * theme stylesheet.
 * 
 * inuit.css aims to do the heavy lifting; sorting objects and abstractions,
 * design patterns and fiddly bits of CSS, whilst leaving as much design as
 * possible to you. inuit.css is the scaffolding to your decorator.
 * 
 * This stylesheet is heavily documented and contains lots of comments, please
 * take care to read and refer to them as you build. For further support please
 * tweet at @inuitcss.
 * 
 * Owing to the amount of comments please only ever use `inuit.min.css` in
 * production. This file is purely a dev document.
 * 
 * The table of contents below maps to section titles of the same name, to jump
 * to any section simply run a find for $[SECTION-TITLE].
 * 
 * Most objects and abstractions come with a chunk of markup that you should be
 * able to paste into any view to quickly see how the CSS works in conjunction
 * with the correct HTML.
 * 
 * inuit.css is written to this standard: github.com/csswizardry/CSS-Guidelines

    $WARNING
\*------------------------------------*/
/*
 * inuit.css, being an OO framework, works in keeping with the open/closed
 * principle. The variables you set previously are now being used throughout
 * inuit.css to style everything we need for a base. Any custom styles SHOULD
 * NOT be added or modified in inuit.css directly, but added via your theme
 * stylesheet as per the open/closed principle:
 * 
 * csswizardry.com/2012/06/the-open-closed-principle-applied-to-css
 * 
 * Try not to edit any CSS beyond this point; if you find you need to do so
 * it is a failing of the framework so please tweet at @inuitcss.
