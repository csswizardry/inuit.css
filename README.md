# ![inuit.css](http://csswizardry.com/inuitcss/img/logo.jpg)

inuit.css is a powerful little framework designed for _serious_ developers.

It is a Sass based, Object Oriented framework that is full of objects and abstractions. inuit.css provides little-to-no design which means no undoing things, no deleting CSS and no adhering to other peoples’ design decisions.

inuit.css is ideally suited to designers who want to focus on the creative and not code, and developers who understand the need for abstraction and an OO approach.

inuit.css gives you design patterns, not design decisions. It features nestable, fluid grids; a double-stranded heading hierarchy; sprites; buttons and a lot, _lot_ more.


**Use inuit.css if:**

* You need a powerful library of objects and abstractions.
* You understand/appreciate the value of OO code and the need for scalability and reuse.
* You are a confident/competent developer comfortable with OOCSS and Sass, as well as familiarity with OO principles in general.

**Do not use inuit.css if:**

* You need a framework that supplies design (I’d recommend [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) for that).

## The developer

There are a million-and-one different CSS frameworks out there so this rather cringeworthy section is an attempt to validate inuit.css and give it some credibility…

I am [Harry Roberts](http://hry.rbrts.me), I am a 22 year old developer and front-end architect from the UK. I work as a Senior UI Developer for [BSkyB](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSkyB) where it is my job to build scalable front-ends, write internally used CSS frameworks and libraries, and to architect CSS and front-end builds.

I [write](http://csswizardry.com), [tweet](http://twitter.com/csswizardry) and [speak](http://speakerdeck.com/u/csswizardry/) about OOCSS, scalable CSS, maintainability, working in large teams, CSS performance, CSS architecture and a whole lot more.

## Documentation

There are no official docs for inuit.css because the code _is_ the documentation. Everything is heavily commented with example HTML. If you struggle with anything please tweet at [@inuitcss](http://twitter.com/inuitcss) and/or [open an issue](https://github.com/csswizardry/inuit.css/issues) and I’ll try help out and use your feedback to improve the documentation.

## Test-drive

If you would like to try inuit.css out before you download anything there is a compiled and minified version of [inuit.css on jsFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/csswizardry/RJqdH/) that you are encouraged to fork and play with. Refer back to [the source here on GitHub](https://github.com/csswizardry/inuit.css/blob/master/inuit.css/inuit.scss) for documentation.

inuit.css, although produced and maintained by one developer, could not have been possible without inspiration and work from an array of other people.
